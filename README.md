## Description
A demo of a CRM built with Django.

Available at [djangocrmdemo.pythonanywhere.com](https://djangocrmdemo.pythonanywhere.com).

This app allows you to create a list of leads or clients with their basic information like name and contacts.
You can also create a list of agents.
You could then assign a lead to an agent, and that agent would be responsible for taking care of the lead/client.
Beyond this, you can create and assign categories to leads like "Contacted".
